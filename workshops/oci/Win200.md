## Introduction

In this lab we will explore more features of Docker and deploy a fully functional containerized version of the AlphaOffice application touched upon in Lab 100. The application is made up of the following four containers:
  - Datasource: Your choice of Oracle 12c Enterprise Edition or MYSQL
  - REST Client: To serve up data from the datasource
  - TwitterFeed: Static Twitter posts related to products in the datasource
  - AlphaOffice UI: Node.js application that makes REST calls to the RESTClient
    and TwitterFeed containers     

You will use various Docker commands to setup, run and connect into containers. Concepts of Docker volumes, networking and intra-container communication will be used.

## Objectives

- Deploy and test the AlphaOffice application
    - Choose and configure your datasource
    - Deploy the datasource, TwitterFeed, RESTClient and AlphaOfficeUI containers
- Once the application has been deployed
    - Make changes
    - Create a new Docker image
    - Fire up a container based on the new image
    - Push this image your personal Docker Hub account

## Required Artifacts

- Docker Hub Account: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
- Docker for Windows Toolbox and GIT installed in your own environment
    - OR, you can use an available Linux based VirtualBox image

- **NOTE:** Windows offers different options to run Docker:
  - Windows for Docker (Uses Hyper-V to stage a Linux VM)
    - This allows for the most transparency but you cannot use Virtual Box in this environment and perhaps you don't need to.
    - It also requires Windows 10 Pro or higher and some participants may not have that on their laptop
   - The older Windows for Docker Toolbox uses Virtual Box and essentially proxies commands to the docker daemon running on a Linux VM. 

 **We have choosen to highlight screen captures from a Docker for Windows Toolbox installation**

# Start up and login into your Windows environment

## Verify Docker Installation

### **STEP 1**: Start the Docker terminal

- Double click on the Docker Quickstart Terminal icon 
  
  - This will start a docker machine called "default". It will take a couple of minutes to fire up the vBox image and get an IP. The default IP address is typically `192.168.99.100`.

  ![](images/200Win/Picture200-1.png)

### **STEP 2**: Verify that Docker is running

- **Type** the following commands:

```
cd
docker version
```

The information on your docker engine should be displayed:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-2.png)

### **STEP 3**: Clone the setup scripts

This will create a directory called AlphaOfficeSetup in your login directory.

- **Type OR cut and paste** the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/wvbirder/AlphaOfficeSetup.git
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-3.png)

### **STEP 4**: Login using your Docker Hub credentials

When prompted enter your username/password. Example shown here:

- **Type** the following:

```
docker login
```

# Deploy and Configure AlphaOffice Database

## Choose the Datasource

In this section your going to chose and setup a datasource for the application. You have a choice between an Oracle 12c database or a MYSQL database. As the steps and commands are slightly different pick one of the flows that follow below. You will start up a database container, connect into the container and run a script that loads the application's schema into the database.

 - ***NOTE: You only have to set up ONE database (Oracle or MYSQL) to use with the AlphaOffice application but can go through the setup of both if you'd like.***

## Oracle Database Setup

### **STEP 1**: Create the database container

This docker command will create a container based on the database image file located in the wvbirder/database-enterprise repository having the tag: 12.2.0.1-slim. 

- Let's take a look at what the docker **run** command options do:
    - "-d" flag runs the container in the background
    - "-it" flags instructs docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the containerâ€™s stdin, creating an interactive bash capable shell in the container (which we will use in a moment when we connect into the container)
    - "-h" We give the container a hostname "oracledb-ao" to make it easier to
    start/stop/remove, reference from other containers, etc
    - "-p" We map ports 1521 and 5600 from within the container to the same ports on
    the HOST for accessibility from outside of the container's private subnet (typically 172.17.0.0/16). This allows the container to be accessed from the HOST, for example. The default port for Oracle's tns listener is on port 1521 and port 5600 is used for HTTP access to Enterprise Manager Express
    - "--name" The name of the container will be "orcl"
    - "-v" This maps the directory where you downloaded the AlphaOfficeSetup GIT
    repository to the /dbfiles directory within the container  

- **Type OR cut and paste** the following (all on one line) substituting your path "**YOUR-HOME**" where you download the AlphaofficeSetup GIT repository files:

```
docker run -d -it --name orcl -h='oracledb-ao' -p=1521:1521 -p=5600:5600 -v /<YOUR-HOME>/AlphaOfficeSetup:/dbfiles wvbirder/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim
```

Example:
`docker run -d -it --name orcl -h='oracledb-ao' -p=1521:1521 -p=5600:5600 -v /c/Users/oracle/AlphaOfficeSetup:/dbfiles wvbirder/database-enterprise:12.2.0.1-slim`

- This will take several minutes to download the image file (since it does not yet reside locally), extract the content and finally create and configure the database

![](images/200Win/Picture200-6.png)

***NOTE: If you make a mistake with the volume path to where you downloaded the AlphaOfficeSetup files you can stop and remove the container once it's created and try again using the following commands:***

```
docker stop orcl
docker rm orcl
```

***DON'T RUN THE TWO COMMANDS ABOVE UNLESS YOU'VE MADE AN ERROR***

### **STEP 2**: Follow the progress of the creation

Once the container is instantiated a default database is configured. Since we've indicated the -it flag on startup we can follow the database creation progess using the docker logs command

- **Type** the following:

```
docker logs --follow orcl
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-7.png)

- When the database is created you will see "**The database is ready for use**" in the log output:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-8.png)

### **STEP 3**: Create and populate alpha schema

In this step we will connect into the database container and run a script to create the alpha schema user and populate the Product Catalog tables.

- **Type** the following:

```
docker exec -it orcl bash
```

- Once into the container you will see a prompt which includes the hostname you set in the docker run command. **Run the following commands** to verify your /dbfiles directory is writable:

```
cd /dbfiles
touch xxx
ls
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-9.png)


- If there are no permissions errors the "xxx" file should be present in the directory

### **STEP 4**: Use SQLPlus to run the script that sets up the database

- **Type** the folwoing:

```
sqlplus / as sysdba
```

- Once in SQLPLus **type**:

```
@setupAlphaOfficeOracle.sql
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-10.png)

- After the script runs you should see a count of 57 and 20 records displayed. These are the records in the PRODUCTS and PRODUCT_CATEGORIES tables:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-11.png)

- **Type** the following:

```
exit
```

- to go back to the HOST

### **STEP 5**: Verify container is running 

- **Type** the following:

```
docker ps
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-12.png)

### **STEP 6**: Setup Port Forwarding

In Linux all container ports published on the HOST server get mapped to the networking loopback interface (127.0.0.1 otherwise known as "localhost"). This has not been the case with Windows until very recently in the latest versions of Windows 10, for example. Since the application we are going to deploy has references to "locahost" we will make some changes to our Virtual Box NAT adapter to allow mapping to "localhost" on our Windows server.

- Open up Virtual Box and select the "default" Linux VM running our docker environment
- Click on **Settings-->Network-->Adpater 1-->Advanced**

![](images/200Win/Picture200-12.2.png)

- Click the **Port Forwarding** button

![](images/200Win/Picture200-12.4.png)

- You will now add all of the ports that the containers will be exposing to the linux VM. These are `5600`, `8085`, and `9080`. The ssh port has been mapped by default as well as ports `8002` and `18002` from Lab 100.

- Click the `plus +` icon for each new entry and **enter** the following for **Name**, **Host Port**, **Guest Port**:

```
emexpress       5600  5600 
alphaofficeui   8085  8085
twitterfeed     9080  9080
```

- When you're done the setup should look like (8002 and 18002 were entered in Lab 100):

 ![](images/200Win/Picture200-12.6.png)

- Click **OK, (TWICE)** and exit out off Virtual Box

### **STEP 7**: Log into Enterprise Manager Express (**optional**)

Enterprise Manager Express comes bundled with the Oracle database you just created which is running in a container.
HTTP access as been defined on port 5600.

- Open a browser (in this example we are using Firefox). 

**NOTE:** If you want to login to Enterprise Manager Express the browser needs the Shockwave add-on installed. Install this into your browser environment by going to the adobe webite and downloading the player from: [Shockware](https://get.adobe.com/shockwave/)

***If you are using the workshop VirtualBox VM Shockwave has already been installed and you will only have to enable it.***

- Go to the following URL:

```
http://localhost:5600/em
```

You may get prompted to enable Adobe Flash. Click the link to do so.

![](images/200Win/Picture200-12.8.png)

![](images/200Win/Picture200-13.png)

- **Enter** the following:

```
Username: sys
Password: Oradoc_db1
Check the "as SYSDBA" checkbox
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-14.png)

## MYSQL Database Setup

### **STEP 1**: Create the database container

This docker command will create a container based on the latest MYSQL database image file located in Docker Hub

- Let's take a look at what the docker **run** command options do:
    - "-d" flag runs the container in the background
    - "-it" flags instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the
    containerâ€™s stdin, creating an interactive bash capable shell in the container (which we will use in a moment when we connect into the container)
    - "-h" We give the container a hostname "mysqldb-ao" to make it easier to
    start/stop/remove, reference from other containers, etc
    - "-p" We map port 3306 to the same port on the HOST for accessibility from
    outside of the container's private subnet (typically 172.17.0.0/16). This allows the container to be accessed from the HOST, for example. The default port for MYSQL is on port 3306
    - "--name" The name of the container will be "mysql"
    - "-v" This maps the directory where you downloaded the AlphaOfficeSetup GIT
    repository to the /dbfiles directory within the container 

- Type OR cut and paste the following substituting your path "**\<YOUR-HOME>**" where you download the AlphaofficeSetup GIT repository files:

```
docker run -d -it --name mysql -h='mysqldb-ao' -p=3306:3306 -v /<YOUR-HOME>/AlphaOfficeSetup:/dbfiles --env="MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Alpha2017_" mysql
```

- Example: `docker run -d -it --name mysql -h='mysqldb-ao' -p=3306:3306 -v /c/Users/oracle/AlphaOfficeSetup:/dbfiles --env="MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Alpha2017_" mysql`

- This sets up a default MYSQL database using the "root" database users password as "Alpha2017_"

***NOTE: If you make a mistake with the volume path to where you downloaded the AlphaOfficeSetup files you can stop and remove the container once it's created and try again using the following commands***

***DON'T RUN THESE TWO COMMANDS UNLESS YOU'VE MADE AN ERROR***

```
docker stop mysql
docker rm mysql
```

- This will take a couple of minutes to download the image file (since it does not yet reside locally), extract the content and finally create and configure the default database

![](images/200Win/Picture200-15.png)

### **STEP 2**: Follow the progress of the creation

Once the container is instantiated a default database is configured. Since we've indicated the -it flag on startup we can follow the database creation progess using the docker logs command

- **Type** the following:

```
docker logs --follow mysql
```

- When the database is created you will see "**mysqld.sock  port: 3306**" in the log output:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-16.png)

### **STEP 3**: Create and populate alpha schema

In this step we will connect into the database container and run a script to create the AlphaOfficeDB and then create the database user and populate the Product Catalog tables.

- **Type** the following:

```
docker exec -it mysql bash
```

Once into the container you will see a prompt which includes the hostname you set in the docker run command. **Run the following commands** to verify your /dbfiles directory is writable:

```
cd /dbfiles
touch xxx
ls
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-17.png)

- If there are no permissions errors the "yyy" file should be present in the directory

### **STEP 4**: Run the following scripts to set up the database, user and tables

- **Type OR cut and paste** the following:

```
mysql -uroot -pAlpha2017_ < /dbfiles/createUserAlpha.sql
mysql -ualpha -pAlpha2017_ < /dbfiles/createProducts.sql
```

- Your output should look like:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-18.png)

### **STEP 5**: Verify MYSQL tables

- **Type the following commands** to confirm the database tables were created and populated:

```
mysql -uroot -pAlpha2017_
use AlphaOfficeDB
show tables;
select count(*) from PRODUCTS;
```
![](images/200Win/Picture200-19.png)

- You should see 57 records in the PRODUCTS table. Enter **exit TWICE** to return to the HOST

### **STEP 6**: Verify that container is running

- **Type** the following:

```
docker ps
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-20.png)

# Deploy supporting AlphaOffice containers

In this section of the lab you will deploy the remaining containers to support the AlphaOffice application

- **TwitterFeed**: This **java** application provides static Twitter posts (via a JSON file) via REST calls. The AlphaOffice UI makes calls to this container and associates the twitter posts to products displayed in the UI.

- **RESTClient**: This **Node.js** application makes REST calls to the selected datasource (Oracle or MYSQL) and returns details from the Product Catalog tables. Selection of the datasource is parameter driven.

- **AlphaOfficeUI**: **Node.js** application container that displays data obtained via the TwitterFeed and ClientREST containers.

## Application Deployment

### **STEP 1**: Run and test the TwitterFeed

- **Type OR cut and paste** the following:

```
docker run -d --name=twitterfeed -p=9080:9080 wvbirder/twitterfeed
```

- This docker image will download the first time, extract and run the container:

- **Type** the following:

```
docker ps
```

- to dsplay all running containers. In this example the MYSQL database and the Twitterfeed containers are seen:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-21.png)

- Go to the browser, open up a new tab and **enter**:

```
http://localhost:9080/statictweets
```

**NOTE:** The firefox browser included in the Linux VirtualBox VM has a built-in JSON formatter. If you don't have a JSON formatter add-on you'll see a stream of text representing the tweets.

![](images/200Win/Picture200-22.png)

### **STEP 2**: Run and test the RESTClient

- Let's take a look at what the docker **run** command options do:
    - "-d" flag runs the container in the background
    - "-it" flags instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the
    containerâ€™s stdin, creating an interactive bash capable shell in the container (which we will use in a moment when we connect into the container)
    - "--rm" When this container is stopped all resources associated with it (storage, etc) will be deleted
    - "--name" The name of the container will be "restclient"
    - "-p" Port 8002 is mapped from the container to the same port on the HOST
    - "--link" A intra-container link to the "mysql" database is created using the
    - "mysqldb" hostname. This hostname is added to the restclient container's /etc/host file. Hostname is used because it is more flexible than using the private IP address of the container that can change upon subsquent invocations. The hostname is used for making a connection to the database 
    - "-e" Environment variables used by the application. "MYSQL_HOST" and "DS" settings designate the MYSQL datasource. The Oracle datsource uses the "ORACLE_CONNECT" variable (an example of that is shown below)

**NOTE: This example assumes we are using the MYSQL database as the datasource**. If you choose to use the Oracle database then that command is in the **ALERT** shown below.

- **Type** OR cut and paste:

```
docker run -d -it --rm --name restclient -p=8002:8002 --link mysql:mysqldb-ao -e MYSQL_HOST='mysqldb-ao' -e DS='mysql' wvbirder/restclient
```

 ***ALERT: If you are using the Oracle database as the datasource the docker command would be:***

```
docker run -d -it --rm --name restclient -p=8002:8002 --link orcl:oracledb-ao -e ORACLE_CONNECT='oracledb-ao/orclpdb1.localdomain' -e DS='oracle' wvbirder/restclient
```

 - **Type** the following:

```
docker ps
```

- to dsplay all running containers:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-23.png)

- Go to the browser, open up a new tab and **enter**:

```
http://localhost:8002/products
```

- A list of ALL products are shown:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-24.png)

- You can also query an individual product. In the browser, open up a new tab and **enter**:

```
http://localhost:8002/product/1025
```

- **NOTE:** In the URL that "**product**" is singular

![](images/200Win/Picture200-25.png)

**SIDEBAR:** If you don't want use a database as the datasource, you can always stop the current `restclient` and fall back to a version that uses a JSON file for the Products buy using: `docker run -d -it --rm --name restclient -p=8002:8002 -e DS='json' wvbirder/restclient`

**OPTONAL:** If you configured both ORACLE and MYSQL databases then you can stop the `restclient` container after testing with one of the datasources by typing: `docker stop restclient`. Then, start another `restclient` container stipulating the new datasource using the appropriate commands already shown at the beginning of this step.

### **STEP 3**: Run and test the AlphaOfficeUI

- **Type** OR cut and paste the following:

```
docker run -d --name=alphaofficeui -p=8085:8085 wvbirder/alpha-office-catalog-ui
```

- After it is running test the completed application deployment by going to the browser, and opening a new tab:
- You can use http://localhost:8085 or the IP of the docker machine VM ( In this example: http://192.168.99.100:8085 )

```
http://localhost:8085
```

- OR

```
http://192.168.99.100:8085
```

- You should see something like:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-26.png)

- Clicking on one of the products brings up details for that item with its associated Twitter comments.

![](images/200Win/Picture200-27.png)

# Make changes to the AlphaOffice application

In this section you will make a couple of changes to the AlphaOfficeUI application. One will correct a typo and another will change the background image. The flow for this will be as follows:

- Copy the new background image into the container
- Connect into the AlphaOfficeUI container
- install the vim text editor
- Fix a typo and specify the new background image
- Save (docker commit) a copy of the changes to a NEW docker image
- Start up and test another AlphaOfficeUI container using the NEW image
- Push the NEW image to your personal Docker Hub account

## Container in-place modifications

### **STEP 1**: Copy a new Background Image

Copy a background image file into the running AlphaOfficeUI container. This file is in your YOUR_HOME/AlphaOfficeSetup directory that you GIT cloned at the beginning of the lab

- **Type** the following: ( substituting **\<YOUR-HOME>** )

```
docker cp /<YOUR_HOME>/AlphaOfficeSetup/dark_blue.jpg alphaofficeui:/pipeline/source/public/Images
```

- Example: `docker cp /Users/oracle/AlphaOfficeSetup/dark_blue.jpg alphaofficeui:/pipeline/source/public/Images`

### **STEP 2**: Install the VIM editor in the container

Even though the orginal AlphaOfficeUI image could have been set up ahead of time with any needed client tools we're adding the the environment on-the-fly to give you some idea that it can be done

- Connect into the `alphaofficeui` container:

```
docker exec -it alphaofficeui bash
```

- **Type** the following:

```
apt-get update
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-28.png)

- **Type** the following:

```
apt-get install vim
```

- Say **Y** at the "Do you want to continue?" prompt.

- Verify the "**dark_blue.jpg**" file is in the container by typing:

```
ls /pipeline/source/public/Images
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-28.1.png)

### **STEP 3**: Edit the alpha.html file   

- **Edit** the `alpha.html` file to fix a typo:

```
vim /pipeline/source/public/alpha.html
```

- Fix the header title to read "**Alpha Office Product Listing**"

- You can also change the body title to whatever you want:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-29.png)

- Save the file and **exit** by hitting the **ESC** key and then holding the **SHIFT** key down and typing "**Z, (TWICE)**"

### **STEP 4**: Edit the alpha.css file

- **Type** the following:

```
vim /pipeline/source/public/css/alpha.css
```

- Change the background image reference to "**dark_blue.jpg**"

![](images/200Win/Picture200-30.png)

- Save the file and exit by hitting the **ESC** key and then holding the **SHIFT** key down and typing "**Z, (TWICE)**"

- **Exit** out of the container:

```
exit
```

# Commit and run the NEW version of AlphaOffice

## Test modified Application

### **STEP 1**: Commit a NEW Docker image

In this step you will save a copy of your modifed docker container and give it a new name. Your back out in the HOST now. Substitute your docker hub account name where asked for in the following commands:

- **Type** the following:

```
docker commit alphaofficeui (your-dockerhub-account)/(image-name)
```
  
- Example: `docker commit alphaofficeui wvbirder/alphaoffice-new`

- **Type** the following:

```
docker images
```

- to see the new saved image

![](images/200Win/Picture200-31.png)

### **STEP 2**: Start a container based on your new image

Since there is already a running `alphaofficeui` container we'll name the new container `alphaofficeui2` and use port 8086 on the HOST since 8085 is in use. We will also use the PORT enviroment variable.

- **Type** the following:

```
docker run -d --name=alphaofficeui2 -p=8086:8086 -e PORT=8086 (your-dockerhub-account)/(image-name)
```

- Example: `docker run -d --name=alphaofficeui2 -p=8086:8086 -e PORT=8086 wvbirder/alphaoffice-new`

- Verify the new container is running by **typing**:

```
docker ps
```

![](images/200Win/Picture200-32.png)

- Open up a new browser tab and this time use the IP Address of the docker-machine VM (in this example `192.168.99.100`). We're just showing that we can use the Linux VM's IP Address as well as `localhost`. You can obtain the Docker VM's IP by **typing** in:

```
docker-machine ip default
```

- Once obtained, then enter:

```
http://\<your-VM-IP\>:8086
```

- Example: `http://192.168.99.100:8086`

![](images/200Win/Picture200-33.2.png)

### **STEP 3**: Push the new image to your docker hub account

Now others will be able to take advantage of the changes you made to the application. In this example "wvbirder" is the Docker Hub account name but you will be using your own account

- **Type** the following:

```
docker push (your-dockerhub-account)/(image-name)
```

- Example:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-34.png)

- Once the push is completed you can log into your Docker Hub account and verify it is there:

![](images/200Win/Picture200-35.png)

**This completes the Lab!**
